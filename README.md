# Zig Objective-C Runtime

Idiomatic Zig Bindings for the Objective-C Runtime API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This package is built on Zig nightly, and will likely only support Zig nightly until the Zig
Software Foundation releases a stable 1.0.0 release. With this limitation in mind, the only
prerequisite to use this package is the latest version of Zig nightly. To install the nightly
build of Zig, download the `master` release from
[The Official Zig Website](https://ziglang.org/download/), or use your preferred package manager
/ editor extension (we prefer VSCode here).

### Installation

To install zig-objective-c-runtime, open a terminal in your Zig project and enter the following
command:

```bash
zig fetch --save git+https://github.com/manateeengine/zig-objective-c-runtime.git
```

Once you've ran the above command, add the following to your project's `build.zig`:

```zig
// Import the dependency
const objective_c_runtime = b.dependency("zig-objective-c-runtime", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});

// Add the dependency's module as an import named "objective_c_runtime" (assuming exe is the name
// of your build)
exe.root_module.addImport("objective_c_runtime", objective_c_runtime.module("objective_c_runtime"));
```

## Usage

```zig
// TODO: Build the package and write usage docs
```

Full usage documentation is coming very soon, as we're currently cooking up a project that augments
Zig doc comments and creates beautiful TypeDoc style websites!

## Running Examples

Examples can be found in the `./examples` folder. Each example has its own `zig build` command that
directly correlates with the name of the directory. For instance, if you'd like to run the example
in `./examples/basic`, you would run the following command:

```bash
zig build example-basic
```

## Compatibility Matrix

This project is not only hand-built, but a major work-in-progress, and won't cover everything that
the Objective-C Runtime has to offer, at least not in its initial release. This table provides an
overview of how compatible this project is with the Objective-C Runtime. See something missing that
you really need? Feel free to open a PR and add it!

**Key:**

- ðŸŸ¢ Fully Implemented
- ðŸŸ¡ Partially Implemented
- ðŸ”´ Not Currently Implemented
- ðŸš« Will Never be Implemented
